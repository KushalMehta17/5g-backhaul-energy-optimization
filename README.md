# 5g-backhaul-energy-optimization
This research project implements an intelligent energy management system for 5G backhaul networks using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Machine Learning. 

## Abstract
The evolution of fifth-generation (5G) networks has substantially increased traffic demands on backhaul infrastructures, emphasizing the need for intelligent and energy-efficient management strategies. This work presents an SDN-based energy optimization framework that integrates time-series traffic prediction and topology reconfiguration to reduce power consumption in 5G backhaul networks. Using an LSTM model, link-level traffic is forecasted for successive time intervals, enabling the identification of underutilized connections. The Mininet–Ryu simulation environment is then employed to emulate the backhaul topology and evaluate performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and energy consumption under different link activation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that proactive, prediction-driven link management can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining acceptable Quality of Service.
