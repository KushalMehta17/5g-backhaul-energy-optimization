# 5g-backhaul-energy-optimization
This research project implements an intelligent energy management system for 5G backhaul networks using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Machine Learning. By predicting traffic patterns and putting underutilized links to sleep, we achieve significant energy savings while maintaining Quality of Service.
